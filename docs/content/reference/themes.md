# Themes

Folders: `static`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_i18n`


Theme can be specified in the `_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
theme: my_local_theme
# or
theme: https://github.com/sake92/flatmark?branch=main&folder=a_folder
```

In the first case, the theme is in the local `_themes` folder.  
In the second case, it is downloaded from the GitHub repository, from a specific branch (default is `main`), 
and a specific folder (default is repo root `/`).
